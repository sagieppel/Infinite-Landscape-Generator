# Infinite Landscape surface generator 
This script generates an unlimited number of 3D landscape/terrain objects that can be used with 3D CGI software like Blender and Unreal Engine.

The goal is to be able to generate a diverse landscape based on real-world patterns without relying on procedural generation.

What it does is take a large number of images and use one of the image maps (mainly intensity) to generate a height map with pixel value as height.
By default, the generated landscape will be square.
However, you can also add a 2D shape (save as binary[0,255] png image) to give the surface a none-square shape.

***Samples of the 3D surfaces generated by  the script (with square=True (top), and False(buttom)). Note, that the script will only generate the object file. The images in this figure were generated using the script in [this repository](https://github.com/sagieppel/Generate_3D_Landscape_Terrain_Recognition_and_Retrieval_Synthetic_Dataset_Blender)***

# How to use:
The script in generate_terrain.py will run out of the box with the sample images and shape folders provided in the repository and will output the terrains/lanscape as .obj files.


## Input parameters:
In generate_terrain.py:

***img_dir*** folder with images that will be used to generate the terrain height map (see sample images folder provided).

***shape_dir*** (optional) folder with 2D shapes saved as binary png (0,255) that will be used to create the 2D shapes of the terrain map (like an island) only used if square==False, otherwise the terrain will be squared  (see sample shapes folder provided).

***out_dir*** Output dir were generated terrains will be saved 

***map_size*** Size of the output terrain map in pixels

***square*** If this is true the generated terrain will be square else the shape (x,y) of the terrain will be taken from shapes in shape_dir


# More resources.
The number of terrains generated is limited by the number of images provided.
If you want a large number of landscapes download a large repository of images from [open images dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html) or  [segment anything](https://ai.meta.com/datasets/segment-anything/).

A large number of 2D shapes can be downloaded from the [LAS&T dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/15453634/files/SHAPES_2D_365k.zip?download=1).

Example for using the generate landscape obj files to create images can be found [this repository](https://github.com/sagieppel/Generate_3D_Landscape_Terrain_Recognition_and_Retrieval_Synthetic_Dataset_Blender)
